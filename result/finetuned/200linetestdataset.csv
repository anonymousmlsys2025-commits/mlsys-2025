Let's go through each condition and translate it:

The conditions are already in a form that can be directly translated into CNF, as each condition is a disjunction of literals. We will represent each condition as a clause in the CNF formula.

Let's go through each condition and translate it:

Let's break down each condition:

   - This means that if Emma has a sculpture in Riverside (x(0, 1, 1)), she cannot have it in City Gallery (x(0, 1, 0)), and vice versa.
   - In CNF: (¬x(0, 1, 1) ∨ ¬x(0, 1, 0))

2. ""Either Mia does not have a sculpture on display in City Gallery, or Emma has a sculpture on display in Riverside Gallery.""
   - In CNF: (¬x(2, 1, 0) ∨ x(0, 1, 1))

3. ""Either Luke does not have a sculpture on display in City Gallery, or Luke has a painting on display in Riverside Gallery.""
   - In CNF: (¬x(1, 1, 0) ∨ x(1, 0, 1))

4. ""Either Emma does not have a sculpture on display in City Gallery, or Emma has a painting on display in City Gallery.""
   - In CNF: (¬x(0, 1, 0) ∨ x(0, 0, 0))

5. ""Emma has a sculpture on display in City Gallery.""
   - In CNF: (x(0, 1, 0))

6. ""Either Luke does not have a painting on display in Riverside Gallery, or Mia has a sculpture on display in City Gallery.""

Each condition is a logical statement that can be expressed as a disjunction (OR) of literals, where a literal is either a positive or negative variable. The CNF formula is then a conjunction (AND) of these clauses.

Let's go through each condition and translate it into a clause:

Clause 39 in the natural language conditions states: ""Either Sophia conducts experiment 2 in module 2, or Sophia does not conduct experiment 4 in module 1."" This corresponds to the CNF clause (x(2, 2, 2) ∨ ¬x(2, 4, 1)), which is correct.\n\n31. Clause 40 in the natural language conditions states: ""Either David does not conduct experiment 5 in module 2, or Sophia conducts experiment 3 in module 0."" This corresponds to the CNF clause (¬x(0, 5, 2) ∨ x(2, 3, 0)), which is correct.\n\n32. Clause 41 in the natural language conditions states: ""Either Emily does not conduct experiment 5 in module 0, or Sophia conducts experiment 3 in module 1.""

Each condition is already in a form that can be directly translated into a disjunction, with the exception of the condition that states a single literal (e.g., ""Zorblax does not present topic 2 in the virtual reality lab""), which is already a literal in CNF.

Let's go through each condition and translate it:

1. ¬x(1, 5, 1) ∨ x(0, 1, 0)
2. ¬x(2, 4, 0) ∨ x(0, 4, 0)
