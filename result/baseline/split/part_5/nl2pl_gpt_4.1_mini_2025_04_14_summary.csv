Here, drone 0 is Drone A, drone 1 is Drone B, and drone 2 is Drone C.","In a futuristic city, three delivery drones—Drone A, Drone B, and Drone C—each operate in different zones and perform tasks. There are six types of tasks (from 0 to 5), and each task can be conducted in one of two weather conditions: clear (0) or stormy (1). For each drone, task, and weather condition, the city management decides whether the drone should perform the task. These decisions are made independently.","1.
