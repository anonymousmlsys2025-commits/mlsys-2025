Here, drone 0 is Charlie, drone 1 is Echo, drone 2 is Tango, and drone 3 is Bravo.","In a futuristic city, four drones—Charlie, Echo, Tango, and Bravo—are assigned various delivery tasks at different locations throughout the city. Each drone is equipped with an array of tools (0 - package clamp, 1 - temperature sensor, 2 - camera, 3 - light sensor, 4 - GPS, 5 - air quality monitor) and operates in one of two designated zones (0 = downtown, 1 = suburban). Each tool assignment and zone operation is an independent decision, meaning a drone can use multiple tools in multiple zones, or none at all.","1.

Each experiment involves testing different hypotheses (0 to 4) across three distinct scenarios (0 = controlled lab, 1 = field study, 2 = virtual simulation). For each scientist, hypothesis, and scenario, the team decides whether the scientist participates in that specific combination. These decisions are made independently, meaning any scientist can participate in multiple or no combinations without affecting others' decisions.","1.
