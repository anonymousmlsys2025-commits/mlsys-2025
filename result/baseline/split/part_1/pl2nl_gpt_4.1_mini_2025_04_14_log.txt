Variable Mapping:  
- Student 0 is Liam  
- Student 1 is Emma  
- Student 2 is Noah  
- Student 3 is Ava  

- Field 0 is robotics  
- Field 1 is data analysis  
- Field 2 is experiment execution  
- Field 3 is proposal writing (Note: The mapping only explicitly lists 0,1,2 for fields; proposal writing is assigned to 0 in the problem statement, but the formula uses 0,1,2 for fields. The problem states "0 = proposal writing" but also "0 = robotics" which is ambiguous. The original mapping says:  
"Let x(i, j, k) mean student i demonstrates proficiency in field j during phase k. Here, student 0 is Liam, student 1 is Emma, student 2 is Noah, and student 3 is Ava.  
0 = Liam  
0 = robotics  
0 = proposal writing  
1 = Emma  
1 = data analysis  
1 = experiment execution  
2 = Noah  
2 = environmental studies  
2 = results presentation  
3 = Ava"  

This is ambiguous because the same number 0 is used for Liam, robotics, and proposal writing. The problem likely means:  
- For i (student): 0 = Liam, 1 = Emma, 2 = Noah, 3 = Ava  
- For j (field): 0 = robotics, 1 = data analysis, 2 = experiment execution  
- For k (phase): 0 = proposal writing, 1 = experiment execution, 2 = results presentation  

This is the only way to make sense of the formula. So:  
- i: 0=Liam, 1=Emma, 2=Noah, 3=Ava  
- j: 0=robotics, 1=data analysis, 2=experiment execution  
- k: 0=proposal writing, 1=experiment execution, 2=results presentation  

This is consistent with the formula variables.  

Hence, the variable mapping is:  
- Students: 0 = Liam, 1 = Emma, 2 = Noah, 3 = Ava  
- Fields: 0 = robotics, 1 = data analysis, 2 = experiment execution  
- Phases: 0 = proposal writing, 1 = experiment execution, 2 = results presentation  

This mapping is used in the sentences above.
